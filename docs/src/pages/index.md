# SWM - Documentation 

Hello there! You're currently browsing SWM's documentation. This website is meant to serve as an entrypoint for anyone willing to dive deeper into how the project functions, in what ways it's currently hosted, learn its history, and so on.

If you're reading this you've either managed to start up the apps yourself locally (in which case: Congratulations!), or you've reached this page via a hosted instance. If it was the former, we strongly recommend checking out the [Contributing](/contributing) page. You'll find solutions to many unforeseen gotchas there, which will prove useful if you'll happen to write code. If, on the other hand, you're just looking around, feel free to give [Design](/design) a read. It goes into details on how the system functions, and could be engaging to study if you're into topics such as Software Design.

## On SWM

The task of SWM itself is quite interesting. It's meant to be a Simple (**S**) Warehouse (**W**) Management (**M**) System, which helps with common tasks, such as reminding owners about expiration dates, reports generation, backups management, etc. While the idea might seem rather simple, there's lots of complexity to uncover here and the project certainly was quite demanding to work on.

If you'd like to try it out yourself, you can check out [volciaki.khenzii.dev](https://volciaki.khenzii.dev) or [volciaki.palubiak.eu](https://volciaki.palubiak.eu). While without proper authorization you won't be able to do much, you will still be able to see how the website generally looks like.
