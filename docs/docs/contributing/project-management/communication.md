# Communication

Communication is obviously a rather important factor when it comes to cooperation on projects like SWM. We use many services to aid ourselves in it, which generally allow us to stay up to date with how things are going. The most important ones include:

- Discord - we have a Discord server, via which all the most important updates are shared,
- GitHub - we use it for hosting our code, alongside tracking the progression of different changes.

When contributing GitHub is de facto the place at which you should start. Issues there are immediately picked up by us, and all the code writing happens there. If you'd like to get more deeply involved in the project our Discord DMs are also open.
