# Hosting

While working on web apps it's always useful to have a shared deployment available to the whole team. In our case that's [volciaki.khenzii.dev](https://volciaki.khenzii.dev), but there have been ideas about adding a second (staging) environment. For a while we've had this `develop` branch created, but ultimately the additional environment wasn't needed.

In the future, where the app possibly could have active users, this staging environment is likely to be reconsidered.
