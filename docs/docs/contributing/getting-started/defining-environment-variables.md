# Defining environment variables

While the website itself will start without defining them (it has some defaults for running in development environment), it's still a good idea to provide some definitions in order to be able to tweak them later on. To do so you can copy `.env.example` provided by the project. Simply run:

```shell
$ cp .env.example .env
```

and you're all set up. Now you can freely change theirs values in `.env`.
